# Laravel Splade

***The magic of Inertia.js with the simplicity of Blade.***

Splade provides a **super easy** way to build ***Single Page Applications*** (SPA) using standard **Laravel Blade** templates, enhanced with renderless **Vue 3** components. In essence, you can write your app using the simplicity of Blade, and besides that magic SPA-feeling, you can sparkle it to make it interactive. **All without ever leaving Blade.**

## Sponsor Splade

‚ù§Ô∏è We proudly support the community by developing Laravel packages and giving them away for free. If this package saves you time or if you're relying on it professionally, please consider [sponsoring the maintenance and development](https://github.com/sponsors/pascalbaljet). Keeping track of issues and pull requests takes time, but we're happy to help!

## Features

Splade gives you a massive head start when building applications. Navigate the documentation or watch the videos to discover its power, but to give you a glance, here's a short overview of some of the best features:

* Splade allows you to use the Laravel Blade template engine and build a single-page application using regular server-side routing without building an API. You still have the full power of Vue.js when you need it.
* Splade aims to stick as close as possible to the default Laravel features and development flow.
* Automatic installer and support for the Laravel Breeze starter kit.
* Besides the SPA navigation features, it has more than 20 interactive components that are huge timesavers.
* Most components are functional and unstyled, giving you complete control over the implementation.
* Other components are styled with Tailwind CSS 3.0, but can be fully customized by publishing the Blade templates. You don't need to rebuild or recompile *any* JavaScript for this.
* Built-in support for Modals and Slideover that can show any route or pre-loaded content.
* Beautiful Form Components with support for Validation and (Eloquent) Model binding. Built-in integration with Autosize, Choices.js, FilePond, and Flatpickr, including async file uploads.
* DataTables-like Table component that supports auto-fill, bulk actions, exports, searching, sorting, and more!
* Support Lazy Loading (templates and data), Persistent Layout, Animations, and Teleports.
* Laravel Echo integration to control browser behavior from the backend (redirecting, refreshing, and showing a toast).
* Built-in SEO (title, description, keywords) with support for Open Graph and Twitter tags.
* Support for custom Blade and Vue components.
* Support for existing Blade and Vue libraries.
* Support for SSR (server-side rendering).

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains over 2000 video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.
